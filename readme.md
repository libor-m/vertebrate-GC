# GC analysis of vertebrate genomes
Analyze GC content in running windows along the chromosomes.

The straightforward way is to plot the profiles - ala *wiggle track* -
along the chromosome. This is kind of an extension to EMBOSS isochore tool:
http://emboss.sourceforge.net/apps/cvs/emboss/apps/isochore.html

Another way is to check the amount of blocks with particular GC fraction.
This removes the spatial effects, but still conveys some information.
