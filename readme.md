# gar GC analysis
It looks like the gar chromosomes are different to other fish chromosomes
regarding GC base content. There is a visible stripe pattern when using GC sensitive
staining. There is a gar genome published. What can we do with that?

## Basic analysis
Take other genomes to compare:

- mouse
- zebrafish

Analyze GC content in windows to get chromosome GC profiles.
For general overview overlap global histograms of the three animals.

Unlike zebrafish, gar has some peaks in the chromosome profiles
